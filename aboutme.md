I'm a recent Arizona State University grad (go sun devils!) looking to change the world one line of code at a time. 

- I have a Master's in Program Evaluation & Data Analytics. 
- My dogs' names are Peppermint and Biggie (they have beards). 
- I live where the sun is always shining with my sweet husband.
